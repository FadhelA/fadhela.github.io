I am Fadhel Ayed, a doctoral researcher in Statistical Machine Learning at the University of Oxford, advised by [Prof. Fran√ßois Caron](http://csml.stats.ox.ac.uk/people/caron/).

My primary research subject is statistical machine learning with Bayesian Nonparametric methods and models. I have been working on two main lines of research: 1) Methodological and theoretical properties of clustering and feature allocation models, with applications to language and network modeling; 2) Privacy preservation and disclosure risk limitation.
